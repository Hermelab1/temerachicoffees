        title: "Beyond the Cup: Coffee in History",
        detail: `While it is considered just a drink taken every morning, coffee actually has quite a long
history beyond its simple appearance. It was born many centuries ago in Ethiopia and
spread to Europe and the rest of the world.The story of coffee is deeply intertwined
with major historical events and transformations.
<h3>The Origins of Coffee: Kaldi’s Tale from the Hills of Ethiopia</h3>
During the 4th Century the Aksumite Kingdom was an influential trading empire in
East African history. Knowing how to utilize its geographical position, trade was
carried out with regions across the Red Sea and furthermore leading to a well
developed economy and its interaction among cultures. Axum territory included
present day Eritrea and northern parts of Ethiopia, easternmost Sudan and even
extended to Yemen & southern regions of Saudi Arabia.
So the amazing coffee history started after the 7th century following the downfall of
the axumite kingdom. Once upon a time, in the 8th century there was a boy named
Kaldi who lived in a small village in the Kaffa region of Ethiopia. He was smart and he
loved his goats. One day, while Kaldi was tending to his goats, he noticed that
something was not quite right. Well, his goats were very personable in general. They
have had some red berries of some bush because they were virtually bouncing with
energy. Like any inquisitive soul, Kaldi wanted to taste the berries. What had followed
was quite astonishing a surge of energy as never before much to his surprise. As it
were, such berries snack has a reviving impact. This idea was totally alien to him and
so Kaldi scurried back to his village with what he had discovered.

The only thing missing was the local monastery and soon Kaldi's tale caught the
attention of the monks there. Curious, about the tale they heard about the berries and
their effects on enhanced their focus and clarity of mind. After preparing a beverage
using the berries, as ingredients and consuming it during their prayer sessions they
found that it helped them stay awake and also improved their concentration and
mental focus.
The monks were pleasantly surprised by the effects of this drink as it helped them stay
awake and focused during the night hours at the monastery.They were cautious at first
about the berries potential to divert their attention from their tasks. Found the idea of
consuming something so invigorating conflicting with their devout
lifestyles.Eventually deciding to throw the berries into the flames resulted in aroma
permeating the atmosphere and capturing the interest of neighboring villagers. The
pleasant aroma caught their attention. Drew a crowd of onlookers eager to discover its
origin.
<h3>Yemen: The Spread of Coffee</h3>
From Ethiopia, coffee eventually made its way to Yemen in the 15th century, where it
began to be cultivated more systematically. Yemeni coffee, particularly from the Mocha
region, became renowned for its unique flavors. The port city of Mocha became a vital
hub for coffee trade, leading to the drink's spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula
and beyond.
In Yemen Sufi priests much like the Ethiopian monks, used coffee to keep awake
attuning their prayers all night long. It did not take long before this drink became
famous and coffeehouses (qahveh khaneh) were established in cities like Aden and
Sana’a, which served as socializing, debating and cultural centers.

By the 16th century coffee was already patronized in the regions of Persia and Turkey
and North Africa and later on became a fashionable drink in Europe. Understanding
the significance of Ethiopian and Yemeni coffee helps relate to the evolution of the
drink from its source region to being the drink of the world.

        title: "The Science of Coffee Extraction",
        detail: `Coffee brewing is an interesting art which involves science the art, which if one has an idea of the dynamics of extraction, can turn an ordinary cup of coffee into a pleasant experience. The quality and character of the coffee brew depend on several scientific principles concerned with the process of extraction and the manner in which the flavors are drawn out of the coffee grounds. 
<h3>Grind Size</h3>
The size of the coffee grind is an important factor in coffee extraction. Water will behave differently based upon the size of the coffee particles. Coarser grind are used with brewing processes such as French press or cold brew, where more time is given to steep the coffee. With coarse grinds, the extraction takes place without the risk of over-extraction and bitterness and a smooth taste is attained. On the other hand, an espresso top coffee would require finer grinds, since espresso preparation is fast and uses pressure. If there is difference on the grind size and brewing method, then the coffee will not turn out well coarse grinds will result in watery coffee while fine grinds will make the coffee bitter.
<h3>Water Temperature</h3>
Water temperature is an important factor when extracting coffee from the bean. The perfect water temperature for brewing coffee lies between 195°F and 205°F. Pouring in water too hot can result in the over-extraction of the coffee such that more of the bitter undesired compounds are extracted nullifying the overall taste. 
<h3>Brew Time</h3>
The reason for this is that primarily the brew time affects extraction in different ways during brewing. This is taken to mean that different brewing setups will require different brew times for optimal flavor extraction. An espresso brewing method in which the extraction of concentrated coffee shot is fast, being about 25-30 seconds so that thick crema is formed on top of rich espresso. On the other hand, methods like French press require a four-minute steep time where most of the flavor is extracted. Such steeping time may even be lengthened in the case of cold brew coffee, whose extraction lasts between 12 and 24 hours, and aims to yield a low, ease-tasting cup through slow transfer of flavors. Finally, given the right coffee brewing method, an accurate brew time adjustment based on the method used will result it in an evenly brewed tasty coffee.
<h3>Coffee to Water Ratio</h3>
You may ask, well how much coffee and water is best ratio for brewing. And this has importance too this will influence the taste and even the strength of the coffee. A general guideline is around anything from about 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6oz of water. The proportions specified for each coffee correspond to personal drinking habits and to the coffee-making techniques themselves. If one uses too much coffee, the brew tastes very strong and has a bitter flavor. The exact ratio will assist in achieving the desired flavors and at the same time take control of the extraction such that it does not go above and over.
<h3>Brewing Methods and Extraction Chemistry</h3>
For the attainment of the best extraction methods, various parameters of one component of the espresso equipment design, such as the size of the coffee grind, the brewing time and the pressure can differ from method to method. As an illustration, espresso machines work on a principle of pressure applied onto the coffee made from fine ground coffee to quickly sip out flavors and oils. By contrast, drip coffee comprises gravity as well as medium coffee grounds to achieve the infusion in a few minutes. Knowing the extraction chemistry refers to the dissolved solid, which is dissolved at different rates within a time frame, is of help when modifying cross each brewing method to reach a particular taste.<br>
Conclusion 
Successful coffee extraction is a delicate balancing act that requires consideration of grind size, water temperature, brew time, the ratio of coffee to water and other method-specific adjustments. All of them are important factors that contribute to the extraction of the best flavors from coffee grounds ensuring good quality brew. Coffee lovers who understand these aspects are in a position to improve their brewing skills leading to consistently great cups of coffee.

Caffeine present in coffee is a booster that enhances attention and focus by inhibiting the relaxing effect of Adenosine which is a neurotransmitter that encourages one to go to sleep. Caffeine has been shown to enhance areas such as reaction time, attention span and memory are markedly improved. In addition to claiming neuroprotective effects, coffee may potentially protect healthy people from diseases of neurodegeneration. There is evidence that the risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is inversely related to the amount of caffeine consumed.
<h3>Cardiovascular Health</h3>
Coffee has complex effects on cardiovascular health and its relationship with heart disease is not completely understood. Earlier studies have indicated that coffee might elevate blood pressure but more recent research has painted a slightly less damning picture. One large meta-analysis concluded that moderate coffee consumption (3-5 cups per day) had no effect on the likelihood of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Coffee may help promote cardiovascular health because of its antioxidant content. Another group of cardiovascular benefits would be the effect of coffee on endothelial cells where it was found associated with coffee polyphenols and a decrease in oxidative stress.
<h3>Metabolism and Weight Management</h3>
Coffee might have a role in metabolism and weight control. As everybody knows, caffeine is a strong thermogenic gas. The gas stimulates the body to use extra calories. According to research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, caffeine can cause the different steps from 3-11% during a short period of metabolic rate. We’ve also discovered coffee’s potential to increase fat oxidation. Coffee naturally contains chlorogenic acids, which have been associated with good glucose metabolism. Several longitudinal study reports on Diabetes Care indicate that chlorogenic acid from coffee can enhance insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation.
<h3>Disease Prevention</h3>
In addition to cognitive and cardiovascular benefits, recent research has further linked drinking coffee with a reduced risk of developing several chronic diseases. Research has consistently linked coffee consumption to a lower risk of colon, liver and prostate cancers a meta-analysis published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention showed that coffee consumption reduced the relative risk of colorectal cancer. In addition, the supposed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects coffee may hasten its preventive potential against chronic diseases as well. Bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols are reported to promote a lower chronic disease risk through antioxidation and anti-inflammation.
